    Abraham Lincoln rose to the presidency in 1860, sparking the withdrawal of seven Southern states that formed the Confederacy
    followed by four more once fighting broke out between North and South. The nation was soon consumed by a bloody civil war as 
    Lincoln pledged to preserve the Union, uphold federal law, and stop secession. The conflict dragged on for over four years, 
    claiming more than 600,000 lives. During its course, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, declaring freedom for enslaved 
    people within the Confederacy. This shifted the purpose of the war from merely saving the Union to a struggle for human liberty. 
    As the first Republican president, he oversaw the Union’s triumph, settling the debate over state sovereignty versus federal 
    authority. Tragically, he was assassinated just days after Confederate forces surrendered, leaving behind a legacy as one of 
    America’s most admired leaders.

    Born in 1809 in a humble log cabin in Kentucky, Lincoln grew up poor and largely self-taught, developing a passion for books, humor,
    and hard work. He briefly served in the Black Hawk War, studied law independently, and later entered politics as a Whig in the Illinois
    legislature. By 1847, he held a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, where he opposed the Mexican-American War. In the 1850s,
    he joined the new Republican Party, and though he lost the 1858 Senate race to Stephen Douglas, his eloquence in the debates gained
    him national recognition and helped secure the 1860 Republican presidential nomination.the preservation of the Union, safeguarding of democracy, and destruction of slavery—secured his place in history as a leader who sought “a more perfect union” with compassion and resolve

    <h2>Addendum</h2>
    <p>
       To design this HTML page, I focused on using semantic tags to structure the content in a way that mirrors the organization
       of an academic paper online. The main historical narrative about Abraham Lincoln was wrapped in the <article> element,
       as it represents a self-contained piece of writing that could stand alone as a publication. Paragraphs were preserved
       to maintain clarity, while headings such as Fighting for Unity and Freedom and Personal Tragedies and Triumphs were
       added to guide transitions. These headings improve readability, enhance navigation, and help readers engage with
       distinct themes.

        Additionally, I included a second <code> element for the addendum, ensuring the discussion of form was separated 
        from the main thematic content. This separation enhances coherence and emphasizes related but independent sections.
        I also applied the <human> tag to provide contextual meaning and inserted a JavaScript snippet to display the last 
        update date, adding helpful metadata for readers.
